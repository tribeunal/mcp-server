/**

 * into a concrete pair — the same rule the backend applies in App\Service\TrialDefaults:
 *   - visibility omitted → private, unless the caller asked for a public jury ("public
 *     jury" has always meant a public case, anonymous voting or not).
 *   - juryType omitted   → follows the visibility: invited on a private case, public on a
 *     public case or a link-poll (private + allowsGuestVotes).
 * Explicit values pass through untouched, so a conflict still reaches the schema's check.
